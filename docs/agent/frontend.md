# docs/agent/frontend.md — Client conventions

> Created during L1-12 from the real client code. Transverse rules → `/AGENTS.md`.
> Protocol → `protocol.md`.
>
> Sources: technical spec §7 · `apps/client/src/`.

## Status

Functional UI only for V1 — no art direction (technical spec §9). Screens live in
`apps/client/src/App.tsx` for now; split further when the surface grows past one file.

## Screens

| Screen | When |
|---|---|
| Home | No room — create / join + nickname |
| Lobby | `phase: 'lobby'` — seats, code, host Start |
| Table | `phase: 'playing'` — opponents, log, queue, timer, draw/attack |
| End | `phase: 'finished'` — winner, return home |

## Conventions

- **Zero rule logic** on the client. Buttons send intents; the server revalidates.
- Connection hook: `apps/client/src/net/use-room-connection.ts` — create / joinById /
  messages / leave.
- Every `stateUpdate` replaces the previous view. Validate shape before use.
- Timer display is cosmetic: trust `turnDeadlineMs` / `turnStarted.deadlineMs` from the
  server, never a client-only countdown as authority.
- Action log is the table's main organ (technical spec §7).
